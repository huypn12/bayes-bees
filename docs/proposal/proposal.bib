abstract="Obtaining complete and accurate models for the formal verification of systems is often hard or impossible. We present a data-based verification approach, for properties expressed in a probabilistic logic, that addresses incomplete model knowledge. We obtain experimental data from a system that can be modelled as a parametric Markov chain. We propose a novel verification algorithm to quantify the confidence the underlying system satisfies a given property of interest by using this data. Given a parameterised model of the system, the procedure first generates a feasible set of parameters corresponding to model instances satisfying a given probabilistic property. Simultaneously, we use Bayesian inference to obtain a probability distribution over the model parameter set from data sampled from the underlying system. The results of both steps are combined to compute a confidence the underlying system satisfies the property. The amount of data required is minimised by exploiting partial knowledge of the system. Our approach offers a framework to integrate Bayesian inference and formal verification, and in our experiments our new approach requires one order of magnitude less data than standard statistical model checking to achieve the same confidence.",

abstract="Stochastic population models are widely used to model phenomena in different areas such as chemical kinetics or collective animal behaviour. Quantitative analysis of stochastic population models easily becomes challenging, due to the combinatorial propagation of dependencies across the population. The complexity becomes especially prominent when model's parameters are not known and available measurements are limited. In this paper, we illustrate this challenge in a concrete scenario: we assume a simple communication scheme among identical individuals, inspired by how social honeybees emit the alarm pheromone to protect the colony in case of danger. Together, n individuals induce a population Markov chain with n parameters. In addition, we assume to be able to experimentally observe the states only after the steady-state is reached. In order to obtain the parameters of the individual's behaviour, by utilising the data measurements for population, we combine two existing techniques. First, we use the tools for parameter synthesis for Markov chains with respect to temporal logic properties, and then we employ CEGAR-like reasoning to find the viable parameter space upÂ to desired coverage. We report the performance on a number of synthetic data sets.",
